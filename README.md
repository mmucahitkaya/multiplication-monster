# 🦁 Multiplication Monster

A web-based multiplication table game with a **smart algorithm**, featuring **2 different game modes** developed for primary school students (especially 2nd and 3rd grades).

> **Live Demo:** https://mmucahitkaya.github.io/multiplication-monster/

## 🎯 Project Purpose

It is well known that students often struggle with larger numbers like 6, 7, 8, and 9 when memorizing the multiplication table. Instead of asking random questions, this project uses a **weighted probability** algorithm.

* **Hard Mode:** By default, multiplication of numbers 5 and above appears more frequently.
* **Error-Focused Repetition:** If a student answers a question incorrectly, the probability of that question appearing again increases (Smart Repetition).

## ✨ Features

* **🎮 2 Game Modes:**
    * **Classic:** Solve the question on a card using the on-screen keypad.
    * **Balloon Pop:** Find the balloon with the correct answer falling from the sky and pop it!
* **🔥 Streak System:** Build up your streak without making mistakes. Special motivational messages appear every 10 consecutive correct answers (e.g., "Unstoppable!", "Legendary Streak!").
* **💬 Personalized Experience:**
    * Enter your name and choose your favorite emoji character (🦁, 🦄, 🚀, etc.).
    * Get personalized praise messages like "Great Ahmet 🦁" or "Awesome Sarah 🦄".
* **🎭 Interactive Feedback:**
    * **Happy Emojis (🎉, ⭐):** float up when you answer correctly.
    * **Sad Emojis (💩, 🌧️):** appear when you make a mistake.
    * **Confetti Rain:** Celebrates every correct answer.
* **🇹🇷 / 🇬🇧 Dual Language Support:** Switch between Turkish and English with a single click.
* **📱 Full Mobile Compatibility:** Optimized touch controls (including a swipeable character slider) work perfectly on phones and tablets.
* **⚡ No Installation:** Consists of a single HTML file. Just download and run.
