# 🦁 Multiplication Monster

A web-based multiplication table game with a **smart algorithm**, developed for primary school students (especially 2nd and 3rd grades).

> **Live Demo:** https://mmucahitkaya.github.io/multiplication-monster/

## 🎯 Project Purpose

It is well known that students often struggle with larger numbers like 6, 7, 8, and 9 when memorizing the multiplication table. Instead of asking random questions, this project uses a **weighted probability** algorithm.

* **Hard Mode:** By default, multiplication of numbers 5 and above appears more frequently.
* **Error-Focused Repetition:** If a student answers a question incorrectly, the probability of that question appearing again increases (Smart Repetition).

## ✨ Features

* **🇹🇷 / 🇬🇧 Dual Language Support:** Switch between Turkish and English with a single click.
* **📱 Full Mobile Compatibility:** Works just like a mobile app on phones and tablets without needing to zoom in.
* **🎉 Gamification:**
    * Confetti rain on correct answers.
    * Screen shake effect and correct answer display on wrong answers.
    * Streak and Score system.
* **⚡ No Installation:** Consists of a single HTML file. Just download and run.

## 🚀 How to Use?

1.  Open the application in your web browser.
2.  Click the **START** button.
3.  Enter the result of the multiplication using the on-screen keypad and press **OK**.
4.  If you answer incorrectly, the system will show the correct answer and remember to ask that question again shortly.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5 & CSS3**
* **JavaScript (ES6):** All game logic and algorithms.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For fast and modern styling (via CDN).
